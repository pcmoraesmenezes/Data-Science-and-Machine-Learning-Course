## Probability vs Statistics

1. What's probability?

    - As a theory probability deals with to predict or calculate the likelihood of future events.

    - As a number probability is a number between 0 and 1 that measures the likelihood of an event occurring. The higher the probability, the more likely the event is to occur.


2. What's statistics?

    - Statistics is the science of collecting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data. It deals with all aspects of data including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments.

    - Statistics is also about providing a measure of confidence in any conclusions.

    - Statistics is a set of tools that can be used to answer questions about data. In other words, statistics is the toolbox that helps us to understand data.

    - Envolves the analysis of past events.


Probability needs rule's to be applied and predict the future. The goal of statistics is to make those rules from the data.

The task of statistical is to look back at the data and try to find patterns that can be used to predict the future. Once we have a model that can predict the future, we can use probability to calculate the likelihood of future events.

The task of probability is to look forward and use the laws made by statistics to predict the future.
