# Machine Learning: Machine Learning Crash Course

## Why Now?

- Data is being collected at an unprecedented scale

- Computers are getting faster and faster

- We have more data than ever before

To the models get a better performance, we need to use more data and more complex models.

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is the science of programming computers so they can learn from data.

### Learning From Data

#### Supervised Learning

The best way to understand supervised learning is beyond an child example. Imagine that you have a child and you want to teach him/her the difference between a dog and a cat. You show him/her a lot of pictures of dogs and cats and tell him/her which one is a dog and which one is a cat. After a while, he/she will be able to distinguish between a dog and a cat. This is the same way that supervised learning works. As long you give the model more data, it will be able to learn and make predictions.

The learning will scale with the amount of data that you give to the model. The more data you give, the better the model will be.

#### Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning is the opposite of supervised learning. In this case, you don't have a label to tell the model what is what. You just give the model a lot of data and it will try to find patterns in the data. For example, you give a lot of pictures of dogs and cats to the model and it will try to find patterns in the data. It will try to find the difference between a dog and a cat. After that, you can give a new picture to the model and it will try to predict if it is a dog or a cat.

#### Reinforcement Learning

In reinforcement learning, you have an agent that will interact with the environment. The agent will try to maximize the reward that it gets from the environment. For example, you have a robot that will try to learn how to walk. The robot will try to maximize the reward that it gets from the environment. The reward can be the distance that the robot walks. The robot will try to maximize the distance that it walks.

## Features

Basically they are the driving force to any machine learning algorithm. They are the variables that you will use to make predictions. For example, if you want to predict the price of a house, you will use features like the number of rooms, the size of the house, the location of the house, etc.

The data that is used to train a model is called training data. The training data is composed of features and labels. The features are the variables that you will use to make predictions and the labels are the values that you want to predict.

In python we define a variable X to store the features and a variable y to store the labels.
